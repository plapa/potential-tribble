### About me 

# I am 
a data scientist currently working at Talkdesk interested in data science and machine learning.
I have worked both in academic and commercial settings, as an end-user of ML algorithms and as a developer. 

In particular, my experience is in computer vision (papers published about it!), database design, and more recently in timeseries prediction and optimization.
